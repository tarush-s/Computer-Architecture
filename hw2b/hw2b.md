You'll implement a two-level Carry-LookAhead (CLA) adder, as discussed in class. This adder will then be used in your processor implementation in a later homework.

## gp4/gp8 modules

We supply some skeleton code in `cla.sv`, including module port definitions and the simple `gp1` generate-propagate module at the leaf of the CLA hierarchy. You will need to implement three additional modules to have a complete 32-bit adder.

You should start with the `gp4` module, which computes aggregate g/p signals for a 4-bit slice of the addition. The module takes the bit-level g/p signals from `gp1` as input, and computes whether all 4 bits collectively generate/propagate a carry. The module also computes the actual carry-out values for the low-order 3b of its input. You should also think about why `gp4` doesn't compute 4b worth of carry-out ðŸ˜‰. The `gp4` module will form the top layer of your CLA hierarchy. Our `gp4` solution is about 30 lines of code.

SystemVerilog's reduction operators will come in handy in building your `gp4` module. They perform a bit-wise reduction like so:
```
wire [3:0] w;
wire or_reduction;
assign or_reduction = (| w);
assign or_reduction = (w[3] | w[2] | w[1] | w[0]); // equivalent to code above
```
Reductions can be combined with indexing to reduce just a portion of a bus:
```
wire [3:0] w;
wire or_reduction;
assign or_reduction = (| w[2:0]);
assign or_reduction = (w[2] | w[1] | w[0]); // equivalent to code above
```

You can run `gp4` tests via `pytest-3 -s testbench_gp4.py`, though their coverage is low so we encourage you to add other test cases as well.

Once you have the `gp4` module working, you can move on to the `gp8` module which will form the base of your CLA hierarchy. The `gp8` logic is a generalization of `gp4` to a larger window size. Though it is harder, you may consider implementing a parameterized `gpn` module that computes generate/propagate/carry-out over an N-bit window. You can then instantiate this appropriately for both `gp4` and `gp8`.

## cla module

Finally, you will build the 32-bit adder module `cla`. Use the `gp1`, `gp4` and `gp8` modules to build your CLA tree and to compute the final sum. Our `cla` solution is about 30 lines of code.

You can test your `cla` module via `pytest-3 -s testbench.py`. This is the set of tests that the autograder will run; it does not test your `gp4`/`gp8` modules by themselves.
